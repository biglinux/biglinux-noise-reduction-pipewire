- GStreamer with appropriate plugins
- NumPy

## üöÄ Installation

### From Package Manager (BigLinux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S biglinux-noise-reduction-pipewire
```

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/biglinux/biglinux-noise-reduction-pipewire.git
cd biglinux-noise-reduction-pipewire
```

2. Install dependencies:

For Arch-based systems:
```bash
sudo pacman -S noise-suppression-for-voice-big pipewire swh-plugins python-numpy gettext python-gobject
```

For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt install pipewire ladspa-sdk python3-numpy gettext python3-gi python3-gi-cairo
# Note: You may need to manually install noise-suppression-for-voice from source
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
./usr/share/biglinux/microphone/launcher.py
```

## üíª Usage

1. **Start the application** from your application menu or run:
```bash
biglinux-noise-reduction-pipewire
```

2. **Enable noise reduction** by toggling the "Noise Reduction" switch.

3. **Select visualization style** using the buttons below the audio visualizer.

4. **Toggle Bluetooth auto-switching** with the "Bluetooth Autoswitch" option.

5. **Click on the center icon** in the visualizer to quickly toggle noise reduction.

## üîß Technical Details

The application integrates with systemd user services to manage the noise reduction pipeline. The core components include:

- **NoiseReducerService**: Manages the systemd service and backend operations
- **AudioVisualizer**: Provides real-time audio visualization using GStreamer
- **NoiseReducerApp**: GTK4/Adwaita-based user interface

The noise reduction is implemented using the [noise-suppression-for-voice](https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice) library integrated with PipeWire filters that are activated/deactivated through the systemd user service.
